* Service and Peer Discovery

When you have machines talking to each over over a distributed system, they need a way to find each other.  This module will discuss the various ways to do this and present the pros and cons of each choice.

* Static configuration

An obvious first choice is static configuration.  Host names and ports are kept in a static configuration file and looked up at runtime.

Pros:
- it doesn't get any simpler

Cons:
- static file means changing config and restarting services when hosts/services change
- very low flexibility in an evolving environment

* Multicast DNS

Multicast DNS sends DNS-SD messages across the network.  Services announce their presence by broadcasting  messages periodically.  Clients listen for DNS-SD announcements and choose a server/service from these messages.

Pros:
- Relatively simple code to broadcast and listen.  Easily accomplished with Go's std library
- More dynamic than config files, new services announce themselves.

Cons:
- DNS-SD doesn't route, so confined to one network segment without a special rebroadcasting node spanning segments.
- Clients poll for changes, reconnect servers disappear.

Example :  Apple's Bonjour protocol.

* Service registries

Service Registries store host/port/service information for services running in a distributed system.  Clients look up services using an API, or by using the registry's custom DNS Server (consul, skydns)

Pros:
- Real time updating
- Spans network routers
- registries are distributed for no SPOF
- Some registries provide more services than just Service Discovery, which may be useful

Cons:
- DNS cache can cause trouble, client must respect DNS TTL
- When using DNS to lookup, requires more configuration
- When using API to lookup, requires more code

Example: Consul, SkyDNS, Zookeeper, Kubernetes Services

* Dynamically generated static configuration

Sometimes you have a client that can't be modified to use one of the other dynamic options.  In a case like this, use a tool that dynamically generates a configuration file for the client.

Pros:
- Allows dynamic config of an otherwise static process

Cons:
- Requires a dynamic SD mechanism, and another tool to watch config values and regenerate config from a template
- Requires a service watchdog to restart the service when configs change

Example:

* Hybrid

The truth of the matter is you'll need more than one of these in a complex system.  Many end up using a primary Service Registry, back it up with DNS, and use confd or other configuration generation tools for things like Nginx.
